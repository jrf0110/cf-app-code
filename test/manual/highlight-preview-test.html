    <h1>Code Highlighting Test</h1>
    <p>A lot of times, I just want to publish some brain dump HTML generated by markdown. It'd be nice to have an app run on some URL pattern that will automatically add syntax highlighting to my code blocks as well as fix indentation problems.</p>
    <p>For instance, the following code block is written using the HTML document's indentation, however, those spaces aren't carried along into the pre-formatting:</p>
    <pre><code>
      var foo = 'bar'
      if (foo <= 'bar') {
        console.log('baz', foo)
      }
    </code></pre>
    <p>I'd also like to avoid adding a pre tag altogether. That's a plugin option to fix that.</p>
    <code>
      var foo = 'bar'
      if (foo <= 'bar') {
        console.log('baz', foo)
      }
    </code>
    <h2>Already highlighted, ignore</h2>
    <p>Anything that's already highlighted should be ignored.</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs javascript">
      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>
      <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (foo &lt;= <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>, foo)
      }
    </code></pre>
